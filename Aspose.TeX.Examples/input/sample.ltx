Hello, World!

Notice ligatures with the \texttt{NoLigatures} option set to \texttt{true}: ffi fi ti.

This is an inline math formula: $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$.
And now a displayed formula: $$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$$
Notice these formulas with the \texttt{RasterizeFormulas} option set to \texttt{true}.

And now it's time for a XPS file included as graphics.

\message{Including XPS and PS (without bounding box specified) files is a kinda experimental feature. You will receive an error message stating that the bounding box of graphic couldn't be determined. Just press <Enter> at the terminal prompt, or set an appropriate interaction mode in the TeX job options (e.g. NonstopMode).}

\includegraphics[angle=-60,height=40mm]{sample.xps}

Notice it with the \texttt{RasterizeIncludedGraphics} option set to \texttt{true}.
